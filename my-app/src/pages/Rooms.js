      <p>
        In the Indian culture, at one time, there used to be 365 festivals in a
        year. In other words, they just needed an excuse to celebrate every day
        of the year. These 365 festivals were ascribed to different reasons, and
        for different purposes of life. They were to celebrate various
        historical events, victories, or certain situations in life like sowing,
        planting, and harvesting. For every situation there was a festival. But
        Mahashivratri is of a different significance.
