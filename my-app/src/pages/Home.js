      <p>
        Mahashivratri is one of the largest and most significant among the
        sacred festivals of India. The festival celebrates the Grace of Shiva,
        who is considered the Adi Guru or the First Guru from whom the Yogic
        tradition originates. The planetary positions on this night, which is
        also the darkest night of the year, are such that there is a powerful
        natural upsurge of energy in the human system. It is enormously
        beneficial for oneâ€™s physical and spiritual wellbeing to stay awake and
        aware in a vertical posture throughout the night.
