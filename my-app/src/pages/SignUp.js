        Legends apart, why this day and night are held with such importance in
        the yogic traditions is because of the possibilities it presents to a
        spiritual seeker. Modern science has gone through many phases and
        arrived at a point today where they are out to prove to you that
        everything that you know as life, everything that you know as matter and
        existence, everything that you know as the cosmos and galaxies, is just
        one energy which manifests itself in millions of ways.
